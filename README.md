# MultiCalculatorCSharp

This is my simple mulifunction-calculator i wrote while learning Java, but ported to C#.
I'm sure it's not the most elegant it could be, but it's a start. I made two separate classes, one that holds methods for getting various user inputs and one that holds methods for doing various calculations based on input.

It features input valdiation where it makes sense.

## Features

- [x] Requesting input from the User:
   - [x] Integer
   - [x] Decimal
   - [x] String
- [x] Calculation Methods:
  - [x] Addition
  - [x] Subtraction
  - [x] Multiplication
  - [x] Division
  - [x] Exponentiation
  - [ ] nth root
  - [ ] Logarithm
  - [ ] non-Arithmetic Calculations
